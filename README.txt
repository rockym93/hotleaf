What is Hot Leaf Juice?
-----------------------

Hot Leaf Juice is a script that turns [markdown][1] formatted text files into html. There are [literally hundreds][2] of other bits of software that do this, but Hot Leaf Juice is different in a couple of ways.

First, it's really basic. Basic enough for me to hack on to work *exactly* how I want it to. It's written to maintain my own site at <http://rockym93.net>. There may be parts of the code that are hard-coded specifically for my site, but that's fine - hopefully, the code is basic enough that you can change those.

Second, and somewhat uniquely, Hot Leaf Juice does in-place formatting of files. I like being able to change the file extension to see the source of a page. Hot Leaf Juice doesn't insist on using its own file hierarchy, it just scans down through whatever directory it's in, looking for text files, and plunks down html files with the same name next to them. 

Third, Hot Leaf Juice is an experiment in coding whimsy. Working with the code, and with the script, is themed around making a pot of tea. This is mostly so that I can make jokes about my site being 'powered by tea' in my footer, but partly also as a way of forcing myself to plan my code ahead a little more. If you don't like it, feel free to move right along.
